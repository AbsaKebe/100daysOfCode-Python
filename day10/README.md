**EXO1** : 
Write a Python program to iterate over the day9 dictionary using for loops and print all the values

<hr>

**EXO2**:
Write a Python script to print a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 15 (both included) and the values are square of keys
Une exemple de solution est la suivante: <br>`
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81, 10: 100, 11: 121, 12: 144, 13: 169, 14: 196, 15: 225}`

**EXO3** : <br>
Reliez chaque clé à sa valeur correspondante en créant un dictionnaire. liste1 contient les clés, liste2 contient les valeurs <br>
`liste1 = ["Millimeter wave","RAN", "NB-IoT","Latency" , "Small cell","LTE", "LiFi", "MIMO", "Network Slicing", "IoT", "Millimeter wave"]`
<br> <br>
`liste2 = ["low-power wide-area network radio technology standard developed by 3GPP for cellular devices and services","low-powered radio frequency base stations built to improve wireless network efficiency","bidirectional wireless system that transmits data via LED or infrared light","connected objects that are able to collect and exchange data in real time using embedded sensors","technology that connects devices to various parts of networks through radio connections", "method of encoding data on multiple carrier frequencies", "amount of delay or time packets take to travel between points", "4G standard that sets the groundwork for 5G technology", "architecture that separates virtual networks into individual partitions", "transmission technology comprising multiple antennas for communication at sources and their destinations", "band of radio spectrum between 30 GHz and 300 GHz and provides high-speed broadband connections to transfer data"]`
